### 2.2 Women's Participation Trend
One of the most significant trends in Olympic history is the dramatic increase in women's participation:

- **Early 1900s (1900-1920)**: Minimal female participation with fewer than 100 women
- **Interwar Period (1920s-1930s)**: Gradual increase to approximately 300-400 female participants
- **Post-WWII (1948-1960s)**: Accelerating growth to approximately 1,000-1,500 female participants
- **1970s-1980s**: Substantial growth to approximately 2,000-3,500 female participants
- **1990s-2000s**: Rapid expansion to approximately 4,000-5,500 female participants
- **2010s-2016**: Peak participation reaching approximately 6,000+ female athletes in 2016

This trend represents a remarkable evolution from token female participation to near parity with male athletes in recent Games, reflecting broader societal shifts toward gender equality.

## 3. Sport-Specific Analysis

Archery's dominance in this period suggests consistent excellence and potentially fewer competing nations in this discipline, allowing certain countries to develop specialized expertise.

## 4. Key Insights and Trends

### 4.1 National Olympic Success Factors
The data suggests several factors that contribute to Olympic success:
- Economic resources and athletic infrastructure (evident in US, Russia, and Western European dominance)
- Population size (generally correlates with higher medal counts)
- Long-term athletic development programs (consistent performance across multiple Olympics)
- Sport-specific specialization (countries excelling in particular disciplines)

### 4.2 Historical Evolution
The Olympics have undergone significant evolution:
- Expansion from Western-dominated competition to global participation
- Dramatic increase in women's participation and event parity
- Addition and removal of sports affecting medal distribution patterns
- Political factors influencing participation and performance (Cold War era, boycotts)

 **Age Distribution of Athletes**
The age distribution chart shows the number of participants across different age groups.

The highest number of participants is observed in the 20-30 age range, with a peak around the mid-20s.

Participation decreases significantly after the age of 40, with very few athletes competing in the 60-80 age range.



**Female Athletes Over Time**
The plot indicates the number of female athletes participating in the Olympics from 1990 to 2020.

There is a noticeable increase in female participation from 1990 to 2000.

The data shows a significant jump in 2020, suggesting a growing trend of female participation in recent years.

**Gender Distribution**
The gender distribution pie chart highlights the proportion of male and female athletes.

Males constitute 72.5% of the participants, while females make up 27.5%.

This indicates a gender disparity in participation, with a higher representation of male athletes.



## 5. Conclusion
The Olympic Games data reveals clear patterns of national dominance, with the United States maintaining an exceptional position in both medal achievement and athlete participation. The increasing internationalization of the Games is reflected in the growing competitiveness of nations beyond traditional powers. The most striking evolution is seen in women's participation, which has transformed from minimal representation to near equality.The data reveals that the majority of Olympic athletes are in their 20s and 30s, with participation declining sharply after the age of 40.

Female participation has been increasing over the years, with a notable rise in 2020.

Despite the growth in female participation, male athletes still dominate the overall participation numbers.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the historical development of the Olympics as both a sporting and cultural phenomenon, reflecting broader geopolitical shifts, changing social attitudes, and the global democratization of sport over more than a century of modern Olympic competition.
